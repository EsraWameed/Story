Hello, to anyone reading this. My name is Esra, and I will be telling
you the story of my life. I think my life has been very interesting due
to the different experiences I witnessed. Therefore, I am excited to share
a little bit more about who I am next!

My story began in the same place that civilization did, mesopotamia, the region
called Iraq today. Really, I don't remember much, I wish I did, but I do remember that
life seemed a lot more simple, people seemed happy.
